# Triple-Chocolate-Cake
This is my favorite homemade chocolate cake recipe.
With a super moist crumb and fudgy, yet light texture, this chocolate cake recipe will soon be your favorite too.

op with chocolate buttercream and chocolate chips for 3x the chocolate flavor. You can also prepare this chocolate layer cake as a sheet cake, too. 
This Chocolate Cake Is:
Extra moist
2 layers, but can be made as 3 layers or as a sheet cake
Soft with a velvety crumb
Deeply flavorful
Unapologetically rich, just like my flourless chocolate cake
Covered with creamy chocolate buttercream.
This pictured cake is a combination of chocolate buttercream and mock-devil’s food cake. You know the Devil’s Food chocolate cake you get at a restaurant or even from a box mix? This is that exact cake, only completely homemade. Notice the reddish tint? That’s where the name Devil’s Food comes from. The baking soda in this recipe reacts with the natural cocoa powder, which results in the reddish color.
